# BMI-Calculator

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms (or pounds) divided by the square of height in meters (or feet). A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.

The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI values based on height and weight. BMI is a fairly reliable indicator of body fatness for most people

BMI is a number calculated from an individualâ€™s weight and height. To find out BMI we will take input from the user (both height and weight) which will be stored in height and weight variables for further calculation. The calculation process is simple, we will simply divide weight in kilograms by the square of the height. Now as per the BMI calculated, it will execute the respective if-else statement. We are also checking if the user is pressing the submit button without entering the inputs, in that case, we are printing provide height or provide weight.
Using HTML we are giving the desired structure, an option for the input, and a submit button. With the help of CSS, we are beautifying our structure by giving colors and desired font, etc.

In the JavaScript section, we are processing the taken input and after calculating, the respective output is printed.
